# machine-learning

> Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the abiblity to learn without explicitly programmed - Arthur Samuel, 1959

- Examples that machine uses to learn are called `training set`
- Each training example is called a `training instance or sample`

## When to use Machine Learning?

- Problems for which existing solutions require a lot of hand-tuning or long lists of rules

- Problems that are too complex for traditional approaches or no known algorithm Ex:- Speech Recognition

- Fluctuating Environments: ML system can adapt to new data

- Get insights about complex problems and large amounts of data

## Type of Machine Learning

- Supervised
- Unsupervised
- Reinforcement
- Semi-supervised

### Supervised Learning

- Training data fed into the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called `labels`

- Target Variable - Class, then classification
- Target Variable - numeric, then regression

Examples of supervised learning

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees and Random Forests
- Neural Networks

### Unsupervised Learning

- Training data is `unlabeled`

Examples of unsupervised learning

- k-means
- Hierarchial Cluster Analysis (HCA)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Anomaly Detection
- Association Rule Learning

Dimensionality reduction in which the goal is to simplify the data without losing too much information.

### Semisupervised Learning

Usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data
Ex:- Google Photos - label one person and it is able to name everyone in every photo

### Reinforcement Learning

- Learning system is called an `agent`
- Agent observers `environment, select and perform actions, and get rewards or penalities.
- Agent must learn by itself what is the best strategy, called a policy, to get the most reward over time
- A policy defines what action the agent should choose when it is in a given situation

Example - DeepMind's AlphaGo

## Main Challenges of Machine learning

- Insufficient quantity of training data
- Nonrepresentative training data
- Poor quality data
- Irrelevant Features
- Overfitting the training data

## End to End Machine Learning Project

- Look and understand the big pictures
- Get the data
- Discover and visualize the data to gain insights
- Prepare the data for ML
- select a model and train it
- fine tune your model
- present solution
- launch, monitor and maintain your system
